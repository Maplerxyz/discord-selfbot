# Mapler's Discord Selfbot
This is a selfbot I made for my Discord community a while back that I decided to revamp. This bot was made in Discord.py and contains some nuke, fun and info commands. Don't worry though, more moden day feautres like urban dictonary search and much more. If you wish to use this, please star this and make some contributions to further support the project.

## Command List

### Nuke
- Banall (Bans everyone in the server)
- Kickall (Kicks everyone in the server)
- Createchan (Mass creates channels)
- Deletechan (Mass deletes channels)
- Createrole (Spam creates roles)
- Deleterole (Mass deletes roles)
- Spam (Spams a message and amount given #)
- dm (Dms everyone on your friendslist)

### Utility 
- Snipe (Snipes the last deleted message)
- Ping (Returns SB Ping)
- Stopsb (Shuts down selfbot)

- Coinflip (Flips a coin)

**(MORE COMING SOON)**
